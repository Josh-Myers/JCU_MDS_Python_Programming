    "We will structure all our Python programs to contain a main function, which is the start of our program. Other functions will be added as needed. Remeber that to use functions we must define them, and then use (call) them.\n",

    "   function body\n",

    "some examples:\n",

    "def getValue(prompt):\n",

    "\n",
    "def getAsCurrency(value):\n",
    "    return(\"$\" + format(value, '.2')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling:\n",
    "To use a function we use its name. If inputs are needed we pass the appropriate number of arguments, and if the function contains a return statement then the call is assigned to a local variable using the assignment operator (=)\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#define main\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    price = getValue(\"Enter the price: \")\n",
